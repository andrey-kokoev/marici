# DPC core normalizer: interpretation

The bounded normalizer implements seven named rewrite rules and compares
critical-pair outputs using the complete core signature

\[
(\text{authority kind},\text{scope},\text{modality},
  \text{support},\text{resource}).
\]

Equal executable output is not enough to join two presentations.  Support or
modality differences remain typed defects, and a selector result requires an
explicit selector coherence cell.

## Legacy projection boundary

The existing authority-composition contract contains twenty valid grants in
its own evidence calculus.  None can be imported automatically into the
resource-sensitive core because the legacy grant records do not declare:

- nominal capability identity;
- exact operation scope;
- resource modality;
- conserved resource measure;
- physical support roots;
- temporal validity epoch.

The result `0/20 core-importable` is therefore not a rejection of those legacy
readout and executor theorems.  It proves that evidence-level grants cannot be
silently upgraded into linear executable capabilities.  Supplying defaults is
explicitly hostile: each missing field requires a source-derived constructor.

The smallest safe next step is to author one native core capability end to end,
then compare its evidence projection with a legacy grant.  Retrofitting all
twenty grants would manufacture authority the original records never claimed.

## First native capability

`native_manifest_challenge_use` is constructed directly in the core rather
than upgraded from a legacy grant. It declares one nominal identity, the
single operation `submit_manifest_challenge`, linear modality, one conserved
challenge use, physical roots at the challenge ledger and configuration
quorum, and an arbitrary active epoch `e`. Its epoch fence normalizes
symbolically at offset zero. The theorem depends only on affine comparisons
within one epoch family, never on a privileged numerical epoch.

Deleting any one of the six constructor fields makes compilation fail. This
is a bounded minimality result: the native inhabitant is not obtained by
defaults, and every field excluded by the legacy projection audit is operative
in the import boundary.
